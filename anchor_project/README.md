# CRUD Blog App - Anchor Program

## Project Description

The **CRUD Blog App - Anchor Program** is a decentralized backend application built using the **Anchor Framework** on the Solana blockchain. It provides the core logic for managing blog posts stored securely on the blockchain. The program supports the following operations:

- **Create**: Add new blog posts with a title and content.
- **Read**: Retrieve and view existing blog posts.
- **Update**: Modify the title and content of an existing blog post.
- **Delete**: Remove a blog post from the blockchain.

### Purpose

The Anchor program ensures that the CRUD operations are executed in a decentralized and trustless manner, leveraging the power of the Solana blockchain. It acts as the backbone for the CRUD Blog App, providing secure on-chain storage and management of data.
